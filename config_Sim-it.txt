Project:
-----------------------------
Project name             = Choose a name for your project, it will be used for the output files.
Reference sequence       = /path/to/reference.fasta  #it can be a gzipped file
Replace ambiguous nts(N) = If the reference contains regions with ambiguous nucleotides, these can be replaced by 
                           random nucleotides to avoid reads consisting out of Ns (yes/no) (Default: no)


Structural variation:
-----------------------------
VCF input                = A list of SV positions can be given as input, look at the wiki section for the format of 
                           the VCF input. This option can be combined with random SV inputs
Foreign sequences        = If foreign sequences have to be inserted in the reference, they need to listed in a fasta file 

Deletions                = Deletions count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of the Deletons (Default: 30-150000)

Insertions               = Insertions count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of the Insertions (Default: 30-100000)

Tandem duplications      = Tandem duplications count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of a single duplication (Default: 50-10000)
Copies                   = The range of how many times the duplicated sequences is repeated (Default: 1-20)

Inversions               = Inversions count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of the Inversions (Default: 150-1300000)

Translocations           = Translocations count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of the Translocations (Default: 500000-2000000)

Complex substitutions    = Complex substitutions count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of the Complex substitutions (Default: 30-100000)

Inverted duplications    = Inverted duplications count (Default: 0)
Length (bp)              = The range for the length of the Inverted duplications (Default: 150-350000)

Heterozygosity           = The percentage of heterozygous SVs (Default: 60%)


Read simulation:
-----------------------------
Coverage                 = The genome coverage of the long reads (Default: 0)
Median length            = The average length of the reads (Default: 25000)
Length range             = The range for the lengths of the reads, it will give a normal distribution around the 
                           median length (Default: 500-150000)
Accuracy                 = The average accuracy of the reads (Default: 88%)
Error profile            = This is a file that contains the error profile of the sequencing technology, the github page 
                           provides ONT, PacBio RS2, Sequel II & Sequel CCS/HiFi. These error profiles will provide the 
                           ratios, which will kept when adjusting the average accuracy to your liking
